# Contacts Manager
## managing those contacts like it's 1996 (but better)

Frontend practice project from [Launch Schools's](https://launchschool.com) core curriculum. Local API server provided by course.

I spent literally no more than five minutes on the design and it shows ;-) But don't let the ugly look fool you, the functionality is there (I hope - fingers crossed). Another thing I did not do was input validation beyond what HTML5 and the browser offer automatically.

No design, no validation - what did I actually do? Where did those hours go? Well, I spent a lot of time on the search. You can search across all fields of the contact details. Give it a try*


\* You need to have node and NPM installed, then clone/download the repo, nun `npm install` in the base directory and then `npm start`- But if you're here, you probably knew that.
